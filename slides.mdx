# Concepts to revisit

- Generics
- Conditional Types
- Template Literal Types
- Recursion ðŸ˜³

Whats Recursion doing here?

ðŸ‘‰

---

Just chilling with the big boys ðŸ™‚

---

## Achtung!!!! âš 

Most of the challenges are not practical but should help make the concepts sync in.

---

# Generics

---

# Conditional Types

Use cases

- Determine types conditionally.
- Define type constrains
- Inferring unknown types

---

## Determining types conditionally

Syntax

```ts
type NewType = Sometype extends OtherType ? TrueType : FalseType;
```

---

## Defining type constraints

```ts
type SupplierOf<T> = T extends { supplier: unknown } ? T["supplier"] : never;
```

---

## Inferring unknown types

```ts
type Flatten<Type> = Type extends Array<infer ItemType> ? ItemType : Type;
```

---

# Template Literal Types

Enable use to:-

- Expand into many strings via unions
- Produce a new string literal when using with a string literal type

---

## Produce a new string literal

```ts
type Choco = "Chocoholics";

type Greeting = `Hello ${Choco}`; // Hello Chocoholics
```

---

## Expand into many strings via unions

```ts
type Vertical = "top" | "bottom";
type Horizontal = "right" | "left";
type Phrases = `${Vertical}-${Horizontal}`; // result => "top-right", "top-left", "bottom-right", "bottom-left"
```

---

## String Manipulation

Typescripts ships with foour helepers

- Uppercase
- Lowercase
- Capitalize
- Uncapitalize

```ts
type Greeting = "Hello Choco";
type UpperCased = Uppercase<Greeting>; // result => HELLO CHOCO
```
